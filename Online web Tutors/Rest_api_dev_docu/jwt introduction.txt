** What is the JSON Web Token structure?
Header
Payload
Signature

Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.

xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz

** Header: 
a = Base64Url(
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
)

** Payload

b= Base64Url ({
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true
})


** Signature

To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that.

For example if you want to use the HMAC SHA256 algorithm, the signature will be created in the following way:

HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)

ex: HMACSHA256(a+"."+b,secret)
